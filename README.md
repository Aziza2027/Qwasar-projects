## About Qwasar
Qwasar Silicon Valley offers remote online bootcamps that can be completed either full-time or part-time. Students of the part-time bootcamps can choose to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays or weekends on Saturdays. All full-time bootcamps meet on weekdays. Students may learn at their own pace with a minimum 12-week time commitment required. Qwasar Silicon Valley uses a project-based learning platform designed for adult learners that incorporates automations and autocorrections. All Qwasar Silicon Valley bootcamps except Full Stack Development are gamified, meaning that students will spend and earn “Qpoints.” As students complete peer code reviews, they will earn Qpoints, and as they submit projects for review, they will spend Qpoints. 

The Full Stack Development bootcamp can be completed 28 weeks full-time or 36-48 weeks part-time. The Full Stack Development bootcamp curriculum covers back end and front end tools, languages and databases, SEO, cloud engineering, and object oriented design. Students will rebuild a database and build three websites. 

The Data Science bootcamp can be completed 28 weeks full-time or 36-48 weeks part-time. The Data Science bootcamp curriculum covers regressions, training sets, structured versus unstructured data, and data collection, display, and storage. Students will learn to use data to improve key business outcomes as well as utilize data as a strategic business asset. 

The Software Engineering bootcamp can be completed 48 weeks full time or 72 weeks part-time. The Software Engineer bootcamp curriculum covers C++ programming, Shell virtual machines sockets, Elixir network programming, and OOP. Students will recode the Redis database. 

The AI/ Machine Learning Engineering can be completed 48 weeks full time or 48-72 weeks part-time. The AI/ Machine Learning Engineering bootcamp curriculum covers advanced machine learning algorithms, linear regression and classification, neural networks, logistic regression, optimization and performance, support vector machines, supervised versus unsupervised learning, Kaggle and large/complex data sets, and reinforcement learning. Students will rebuild Slack or Skype, rebuild two databases, and code several key C libraries. 

The DevOps and Cloud Engineer can be completed 48 weeks full-time or 72 weeks part-time. The DevOps and Cloud Engineer bootcamp curriculum covers software architecture and infrastructure, databases, web databases, cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), Docker, Kubernetes, virtual machines, scripts and automation, monitoring systems, logs, Terraform, Puppet, Ansible, Chef, DNS, CICD, Jenkins, network programming, and code automation in a public IaaS cloud infrastructure. 

Bootcamp students will complete 40 technical interviews to prepare for real world interviews upon graduation. Students will gain soft skills, including job negotiations and conflict resolution through role play with other members of their bootcamp cohort. Over the course of the bootcamp, students will develop a technical-based portfolio with numerous projects to showcase to potential employers. 

All successful bootcamp students will earn a certificate of completion from Qwasar Silicon Valley.
