## About Qwasar

Qwasar Silicon Valley offers remote online bootcamps that can be completed either full-time or part-time. Students of the part-time bootcamps can choose to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays or weekends on Saturdays. All full-time bootcamps meet on weekdays. Students may learn at their own pace with a minimum 12-week time commitment required. Qwasar Silicon Valley uses a project-based learning platform designed for adult learners that incorporates automations and autocorrections. All Qwasar Silicon Valley bootcamps except Full Stack Development are gamified, meaning that students will spend and earn “Qpoints.” As students complete peer code reviews, they will earn Qpoints, and as they submit projects for review, they will spend Qpoints. 

Bootcamp students will complete 40 technical interviews to prepare for real world interviews upon graduation. Students will gain soft skills, including job negotiations and conflict resolution through role play with other members of their bootcamp cohort. Over the course of the bootcamp, students will develop a technical-based portfolio with numerous projects to showcase to potential employers. 

All successful bootcamp students will earn a certificate of completion from Qwasar Silicon Valley.
